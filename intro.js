/* Rules when naming variables
1. We should use camelcase naming convention
2. Js is case sensitive
3. Don't start variables with numbers, always start with a lower case
4. Do not use reserved keywors
5. As a rule of thumb use const or let to create variables, there is also the var keyword but we do not it
